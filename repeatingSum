#Problem Repeating Sum
"""Concepts required: If statements, Loops

Write a function called repeatingSum that takes a positive integer and returns the sum of all digits that match the next digit in the integer.

Below are some examples where I underlined the digits that match the next digit.

repeatingSum(1122) → 3
The sum is 3 because the first digit (1) matches the one following it, and the third digit (2) matches the one following it. 
1 + 2 = 3

repeatingSum(3333) → 9
The sum is 9 because each of the first 3 digits are repeated.
3 + 3 + 3 = 9

repeatingSum(121212) → 0
The sum is 0 because there are no consecutive digits.

repeatingSum(12212112) → 3
The sum is 3 because the second digit (2) repeats and the sixth digit (1) repeats.

You can assume the input number will always be an integer greater than 0."""

def repeatingSum(num):
  num = str(num)
  count = 0
  i=0
  for number in num:
    i+=1
    if i< len(num):
      if number == num[i]:
        count += int(number)
        print(count)
  return count
